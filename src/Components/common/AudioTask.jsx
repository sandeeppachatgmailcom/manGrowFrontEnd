           <h5 >🎤 Choosing Songs: Each person gets to pick 2-3 songs from either Malayalam or Tamil movies 🎥 </h5> 
           <p>Reading Lyrics: Instead of singing, each student will translate the lyrics into English and recite them aloud to their batchmates 🎙
            🎧 Listening Carefully: While one person is reading the lyrics, everyone else needs to listen closely to the words, but no Googling allowed 🙅‍♂
            🧐 Guessing the Song: If you think you know which song is being read, raise your hand and say the name of the movie and the title of the song. You can even sing a few lines from the song if you’re confident 😎
            🏆 Determining the Winner: The person who correctly guesses the most songs wins the game 🥳
